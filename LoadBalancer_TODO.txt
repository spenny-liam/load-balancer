Load balancing aglorithm
	job queue (attribute of network singleton)
	
worker node completing job
worker node returning completed job
	load balancer decrementing worker.currentJobs by 1


Check status of workers
	in network, method "checkAllConnections()"
		for each worker: worker.checkconnection()
^requires some sort of "Message" class for load balancer to send something
that is not a job or worker


jobserver currently has manual run, auto (random). set up hard coded tests - 
1. simple 10 requets with varied wait times.
2. send requests with really long wait times
3. send wait times of 0
4. send wait times of negative numbers
5. send things that are not jobs
6. send millions of jobs
